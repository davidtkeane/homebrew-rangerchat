        Welcome Message:
        The ohai command is used to display a welcome message: Welcome to RangerChat! ðŸ’€ Installing the tool now...
        Python Check and Installation:
        The script checks if Python is installed by running python3 --version.
        If Python is already installed, it displays the version.
        If Python is not installed, the formula installs it using brew install python@3.10.
        Running the setup.py Script:
        The formula runs the setup.py script using system "python3", "setup.py", "install".
        This ensures that the setup process (which prompts for the OpenAI API key) is included as part of the installation.
        Exit Message:
        After installation, a success message is displayed: RangerChat has been successfully installed! ðŸŽ‰ You can now use 'rgpt' from the command line.
        Testing the Installation:
        The test do block verifies that the rgpt --help command works after installation.

    * Installation Flow:
        Check for Python:
        If Python is installed, it shows the version and proceeds.
        If Python is not installed, Homebrew installs the required Python version.
        Run setup.py:
        The formula runs setup.py, which will ask for the OpenAI API key as part of the setup process.
        Install the rgpt Command:
        The formula installs the rgpt.py script and creates the rgpt command.
        Display Success Messages:
        A welcome message is shown at the start, and a success message is shown at the end of the installation.
