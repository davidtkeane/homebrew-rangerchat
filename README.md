# RangerChat: Your Personal Command-Line GPT-4 Companion

## üí¨ Introduction

Welcome to **RangerChat**, a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool that lets you interact with OpenAI's GPT-4 model directly from your terminal. Whether you're a developer, student, or just curious about AI, this tool is designed to make interacting with GPT-4 easy, fast, and intuitive.

With RangerChat, you can:

- Send queries to GPT-4 right from the terminal.
- Log your conversations to track them later.
- Customize your model and preferences.

This project was created to simplify the process of querying OpenAI models from the command line. Built with üíª by **Ranger** and powered by OpenAI, this tool is your all-in-one AI assistant!

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. **Prerequisites**

Before installing and running RangerChat, you'll need to make sure a few things are in place:

1. **Python 3.5+ or 2.7+**: The script requires Python installed on your system.
2. **OpenAI API Key**: Get your API key from OpenAI at [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

#### Installing Python

If you don't have Python installed, follow these steps:

- **Windows**:
  - Download the installer from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  - Run the installer, and be sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
- **macOS**:
  - You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Run the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    brew install python
    ```
- **Linux**:
  - You can install Python using your package manager:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3
    ```

### 2. **Installation Guide**

#### 2.1 Clone the Project

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rangerchat.git
cd rangerchat
```

#### 2.2 Install Required Python Packages

Run the `setup.py` file to check your Python version, ensure pip is installed, and automatically install the required packages.

```bash
python setup.py
```

This will:

- Check that Python is installed and meets the version requirements.
- Check if `pip` is installed, and install necessary packages from `requirements.txt`.
- Prompt you for your OpenAI API key.

### 3. **OpenAI API Key**

You‚Äôll need an OpenAI API key to use this tool. You can get one by signing up at [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Once you have your API key, you‚Äôll be prompted to enter it during setup. It will be saved in a `.env` file located in the `~/rgpt/` folder.

### 4. **Explanation of Files**

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the files included in this project:

- **`setup.py`**: The main installation script that sets up the environment, installs dependencies, and sets up your API key.
- **`rgpt.py`**: The core Python script to send queries to GPT-4 and log responses.
- **`rgpt.txt`**: The conversation log file that records all your interactions with GPT-4.
- **`.env`**: Stores your OpenAI API key securely so the script can access it.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Contains the list of Python libraries required for the script to run (e.g., `openai`, `python-dotenv`).
